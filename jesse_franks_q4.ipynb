    "\n",
    "Finite state machines do well for simple problems with a small number of states. This problem could be represented relatively well by a finite state machine because it does fit these parameters. However, behavior trees help to model dynamic decision-making and reactive behavior based on their environment. This problem contains these traits. Behavior trees are much more scalable, which is helpful when this problem gets more complex with obstacles or other new variables."
